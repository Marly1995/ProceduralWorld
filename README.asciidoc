## Information

A procedural generation unity project made for a university module.

Parameters on the Island Generator game object can be used to generate worlds.

Please be aware the project is currently in early developement and therefore does not feature any threading or optimization to make testing and implimenting new features less complex.
Hopefully these features will be added in the final build.
